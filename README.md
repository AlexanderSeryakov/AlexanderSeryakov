        <strong style="font-size: 30px">About me</strong>
        <p>Web development turned out to be very exciting for me, 
            I started my journey with the Python language, developed 
            several commercial projects for small businesses using Python 
            frameworks such as FastAPI, Django, and also developed the Front 
            End for my applications.
